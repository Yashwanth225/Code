PREVENTING RECURSIVE FUTURE METHOD CALLS IN SALESFORCE

One issue that you can run into when using future methods is writing a trigger with a future method that calls itself recursively. 
Here is a simple scenario. 
You have a trigger that inserts/updates a record (or a batch of them) and then makes a future method call that performs more processing on the same record
The issue is that this entire process becomes recursive in nature and you receive the error, 
"System.AsyncException: Future method cannot be called from a future method..." Here is what it looks like:

public class AccountProcessor{
	@future
	public static void processAccount(Set<String>names){
		List<Account> accountsToUpdate = new List<String>();
		for( Account a : [select id, name, isFutureContent_c from Account where UniqueNames_c IN; names]){
			a.isFutureContent_c = true;
			accountsToUpdate.add(a);
		}
		update accountsToUpdate;
	}
}

----------------------------------------------------------------

trigger ProcessAccounts on Account(before insert, before update){
	List<String> uniquenames = new List<String>();
	for(Account a : Trigger.New){
		if(a.isFutureContent_c){
			a.isFutureContent_c = false;
		}else{
			UniqueNames.add(a.UniqueNames_c);
		}
	if(!UniqueNames = isEmpty){
		AccountProcess.processAccounts(uniquenames);
	}
	}
}
